# Heuns Method
========
Heuns Method is a Numerical Method for solving Ordinary Differential Equations when given an initial value. 
It is similar to Euler's Method, but slightly modified.
The inputs are function f(t,y), the a to b interval, initial condition, and the number of subintervals.
The outputs are computed solution and the time steps.
The function has to be continuous.
