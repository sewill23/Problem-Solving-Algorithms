# False Positions
======
The purpose of this algorithm is to estimate the root of any function.
The inputs are Xl = the lower guess, Xu = the upper guess, es = the desired relative error (should default to 0.0001%), 
and maxiter - the number of iterations desired (should default to 200).
The outputs are root = the estimated root location, fx = the function evaluated at the root location, ea = the approximate 
relative error (percentage), and iter = the number of performed iterations.
The function needs to be at least three input values
