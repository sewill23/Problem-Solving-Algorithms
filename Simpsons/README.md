# Simpson's 1/3 Rule
The Simpson's Rule is useful when the Trapezoidal Rule is not able to give an accurate answer. The Simpson's Rule is used best
with polynomials with up to the cubic degree.
The inputs are odd or even numbers (x vector).
The output is the solution: area under the curve.
This Rule can only be used for third degree polynomials and under.
