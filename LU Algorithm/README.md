# LU Factorization
## With Partial Pivoting
This Algorithm is used to find the determinant of a general square matrix.
It uses a process of switching rows and columns to define the triangle matrices.
It can be useful when speeding up Gaussian Elimination.
The input is A = coefficient matrix in the format of A = [a(11) a(12); a(21) a(22)].
The outputs are L = lower triangular matrix, U = upper triangular matrix, and P = pivot matrix.
Your matrices need to be square or ignore the last equation.
